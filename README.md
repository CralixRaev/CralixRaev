# Hello there 👋🏼

Welcome! 🙃
My name is Anatoly, and i'm 15. (actually, i am an Anatoly Anatolievich lol)

🇷🇺 🤝 🇺🇦 Speak cyrillic

For now my primary language is Python, but i actively learn Golang.
I graduaded from Yandex Academy Lyceum as a excellent student ☺️

Except programming, i'm passionate about computer networks. 
I accidentally took third place in the Worldskills Junior competition in the computer networking module.

Now i'm working on creating nice and enjoyable to use [Python api wrapper](https://github.com/CralixRaev/pyMoysklad) for russian CRM and WMS system called Moysklad 🛠.
